# Cryptography Lab

This repository contains the lab exercises for the Cryptography course, implemented in C.

## Lab 1: Classical Encryption Techniques

This lab focuses on implementing various classical encryption algorithms, covering Monoalphabetic, Polyalphabetic, and Transposition ciphers.

### Questions Implemented

- **Q1.c**: Write a program to illustrate the **Caesar Cipher** (Monoalphabetic Cipher).
- **Q2.c**: Write a program to illustrate the **Hill Cipher** (Monoalphabetic Cipher).
- **Q3.c**: Write a program to illustrate the **Vigenère Cipher** (Polyalphabetic Cipher).
- **Q4.c**: Write a program to illustrate the **Playfair Cipher** (Polyalphabetic Cipher).
- **Q5.c**: Write a program to illustrate the **Rail Fence Cipher** (Transposition Cipher).
- **Q6.c**: Write a program to illustrate the **Row Transposition Cipher** (Transposition Cipher).

## How to Run

Each question is a standalone C program. You can compile and run them using GCC.

Example for Q1:
```bash
gcc Lab_1/Q1.c -o Lab_1/Q1
./Lab_1/Q1
```
